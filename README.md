# RNN based Spoken Digits Classifier 

This repository contains my submission for the **Innatera Staff Embedded Neuromorphic Applications Engineer** home assignment. The goal was to train and optimize an RNN-based classifier on the **Free Spoken Digits Dataset (FSDD)**, under increasingly strict hardware constraints.

The project follows the three tasks outlined in the assignment:
1. Train a model without constraints
2. Retrain under memory and fixed-point constraints
3. Retrain with power-of-two quantized weights
